# Hello-World

Hi! I'm La√≠s, a Physics PhD student from Brazil. I'm interested in Deep Learning and General Machine Learning Algorithms. (I also have two fluffy cats and I play rugby! Occasionally I also play the guitar, write in my blog, and adveture myself in the kitchen LoL) 

This is my LinkedIn:

As you may see, I'm still working in my github, building new projects and learning about software development. 
Hope you find interesting stuff around here.

Cheers!
